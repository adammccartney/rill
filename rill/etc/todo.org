** New branch ensemble v2.0

*** TODO Create new score template 
+ update materials/instruments/definition.py
+ update tools/ScoreTemplate.py
+ test new Template by running ScoreTemplate.py locally

*** TODO Import new segment maker from marana
+ replace rill/tools/SegmentMaker.py with marana/tools/SegmentMaker.py
+ compare differences, update functions:
  - _get_music_voices(self)
  - _get_staves(self)
  - _handle_time_signatures(self)
  - _sort_instruments_by_clef(self)
  - run(self)

*** TODO generate new structure for segments
+ recursively delete all existing subdirectories and files in segments 
+ import generator scripts from marana
+ run `generateSegments.sh` on the empty segments directory
+ rewrite DefGen.py to reflect structure of new score template 
+ update makefile in builds to reflect new segments
+ delete all pdfs from builds/letter-portrait
+ update segments.ily file

*** TODO Test build all segments and run make on the score

*** TODO Find solution for missing instrument name markups

** Initial Setup of v1.0 

*** 8-7-20

 + ~~Write test for `material_methods.py`~~
 + ~~Create push/pop methods for PhraseStream containers list~~
  - ~~okay, better way, refactor the code in  PhraseMaker module~~
  - ~~this all worked fine, Phrases are making it to Instrument Voices in
    Score~~
  - ~~there is a problem to solve with `segment_maker._configure_score()`~~
 + ~~Clean up segments B-G~~ 

 + Test a build with travis
  - Read testing with pytest and figure out how to use it properly;-)!

 + rework material in segments, each segment is 64 bars long
  - we could make all the harmonies (one harmony and inversions) for each
    segment and store these in a dictionary with a reference 
  - the `make_diads` routine is resulting in some pretty jumpy intervals, try
    reducing the complexity of this a bit and see if in doing so, it's possible
    to produce smoother lines. 
  - one arpeggio pattern per harmony (three in total) 

 + Write violin part 
 
 + Write methods for attachments (markup + dynamics)

*** 16-6-20
 
 + ~~Research a way to use RhythmDefinition.py effectively~~
  - ~~refine the routine used to produce an rmaker~~
  - ~~define a pitches property in FuzzyHarmony~~
  - ~~this can be used in making rmakers~~
  - ~~check viability with Trevor's RhythmDefinition~~

 + ~~Fix linkage to stylesheets~~ 
  - ~~run same segment A test and fix errors on build~~

*** 15-6-20

 + ~~Clean up tested code~~
 + ~~Make a working segment~~
  - ~~first build a score example using existing code~~
  - ~~figure out how to handle overlapping rmakers~~

*** 28-5-20

 + ~~Read abjad.Chord to see if method exists to create invertion~~
 + ~~Create method to invert guitar chords stored in abjad.OrdinaryDict~~
 + ~~Iteratively invert all chords~~
  - ~~Why would you want to build a static resource that holds all~~
    ~~possible inversions?~~
  - ~~Inversions are more commonly found in sequences~~
  - ~~Therefor it makes more sense to write a simple dictionary of used
    chords~~
    ~~and import a routine for inversion~~
 + ~~Make quick notational sketch of possible guitar figures~~
  - ~~pre-requisites:~~ 
   + ~~these should be as general as possible, so they can be ported to other~~
     ~~instruments incase the instrumentation changes by the autumn and so that~~  
     ~~they can be used for the harp parts in the orchestral piece later in the~~
     ~~summer~~

Data Structure:

 + ~~Clarification of what we want to do with these chords:~~
  - ~~Write a routine that outputs all possible harmonic progressions:~~
   + [[ii - v - i], [iib - v - i], [iib, v, ia], [ii - v -i]]
  - ~~Once these harmonic progressions are formed, it's possible~~ 
    ~~to express the harmonic material as chords or pitch segments~~
    ~~and to use these in collaboration with rmakers to create actual~~
    ~~"phrases"~~


* ~~Figure out if there is some way to make a selection based on a PitchSegment~~  
  - ~~review abjad music maker def by Trevor (abjad users::re:rmakers)~~
  - ~~build verbatim example to see how iterators are making leaves~~
 + ~~Make do-ability survey (impossible, hard, easy) 
 + ~~Send notes + survey to guitarists~~


# 20-5-2020 Next Steps
