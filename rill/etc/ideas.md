rill (erosion)
===============================================================================

v1.0 

a rill is the soft impression left in the soil in the wake of a soft, lightly 
flowing stream of water. in nature, a rill will form part of a network. 

In musical terms, the basic idea will be to map the two elements acoustically: 
 
 + chaotic (as in mathematics) melodies in poly modal space
 + a delayed tremolo texture that follows the same outline 


The score is a sequence of short pieces or fragments that explore this
idea.  

# Classes, tools and methods

## General Methodology

The general approach to getting music into the score is through the
instantiation of a SegmentMaker class. Basically, this class contains
a ScoreTemplate as a member, which in turn contains the reference information
about "voices" and "staves" contained within the score. 

The score is divided into a number of discrete segments and these are
created as instances of the class in a `semgent_$x/definition.py`
file.
