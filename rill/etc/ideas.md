# rill (erosion)  #
===============================================================================

a rill is the soft impression left in the soil in the wake of a soft, lightly 
flowing stream of water. in nature, a rill will form part of a network. 

In musical terms, the basic idea will be to map the two elements acoustically: 
 
 + chaotic (as in mathematics) melodies in poly modal space
 + a delayed tremolo texture that follows the same outline 


The score is a sequence of short pieces or fragments that explore this
idea.
